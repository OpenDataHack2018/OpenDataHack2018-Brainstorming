# OpenDataHack2018-Brainstorming
Ahead of #OpenDataHack2018 @CopernicusECMWF, submit and discuss your ideas with other OpenDataHackers and get a team ready to hack on 9-10 June 2018 at ECMWF! 



Come and join us on #OpenDataHack2018 @CopernicusECMWF and show us how you can mine information from open climate data. Take this opportunity to delve into the <a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/climate-data-store">Copernicus Climate Data Store</a> and get a first-hand dive into its applications cloud environment!  Exercise your out-of-the-box thinking and showcase your solutions to climate change challenges. 

The #OpenDataHack2018 @ECMWF is a hackathon weekend event on 9/10 June 2018 for developers, designers, data wranglers, data journalists, data enthusiasts, entrepreneurial minds and everyone interested in unleashing their creativity with freely available climate data.

Be part of #OpenDataHack2018 @CopernicusECMWF to build, pitch and win with your original ideas and solutions to climate change challenges. 

The goal of the hackathon is to discover the potential of open climate data and to come up with innovative ideas how Copernicus data at ECMWF can be used:

<ul>
<li><b>Hack-Data</b>

Calling on climate data hackers to synthesize available datasets and turn them into useful insights and information (e.g. value-added services)....This is data mining at its best!

Submit <a href="https://github.com/OpenDataHack2018/OpenDataHack2018-Brainstorming/issues">here</a> your Hack-Data Challenge ideas and start brainstorming your project with other data hackers! 

<li><b>Hack-Vis</b>

With visualization at the heart of data communication, this is the opportunity for tools designers to pioneer new apps and show the world the power of climate data! Bring it on!

Submit <a href="https://github.com/OpenDataHack2018/OpenDataHack2018-Brainstorming/issues">here</a> your Hack-Vis Challenge ideas and start elaborating your project!
 
<li><b>Hack-Out</b>

Can you think of any funky and catchy ideas with climate data? Do you want to help widening climate outreach engagement across the wider spectrum of society? This is your chance! Implement your innovating offbeat concept using climate data and you could have the next global craze at your fingertips!
